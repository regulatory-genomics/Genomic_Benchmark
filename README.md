# Genomic_Benchmark
Benchmark for DNA sequence-based model

A comprehensive benchmark for genomic data processing and analysis.

## Data Processors

The project provides two (will be more) main data processors for handling different types of genomic data:

### Enhancer Processor
The `EnhancerProcessor` is designed for processing enhancer-gene interaction data. It supports multiple datasets including Gasperini, Fulco, Schraivogel and Merged datasets.

Usage guide: <https://github.com/regulatory-genomics/Genomic_Benchmark/blob/main/docs/data/enhancer_processor_guide.md#enhancerprocessor-user-guide>

### eQTL Processor
The `EQTLProcessor` is designed for processing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data. It supports GTEx v8 and other eQTL datasets.

Usage guide: [eQTL Processor Guide](docs/eqtl_processor_guide.md)
